Welcome to Pat Prodanovic's utilities for free surface flow modeling!

Change-log:

1.01 (September 16, 2015): Code cleanup of the original 1.0 version; added a module called ppmodules that so far contains only the readAdcirc function.

1.02 (September 20, 2015): Changed the mkbreakline.py script from what I had previously; now it creates pputils 3b breakline, and has the ability to fill in missing nodes at the breakline if it encounters one; added breaklines2dxf.py script that writes the 3d breaklines from pputils format to dxf format.

1.03 (September 25, 2015): Got rid of some of the proprietary examples; comments in the code were cleaned up; added breaklines2wkt.py script that writes the 3d breaklines from pputils format to WKT format; fixed the issue with gis2triangle.py and gis2triangle_kd.py scripts when having only one hole.

1.04 (September 30, 2015): Updated wkt2csv.py to include option -t LINESTRING_XYZ used to extract nodes from the pputils formatted lines file.

1.05 (October 31, 2015): Updated probe.py to work better when result files have small number of time steps; added a transp.py script that interpolates result files from one mesh onto another (for a specified time step); added assign.py to assign attributes defined by polygon boundaries to the mesh nodes; added to wkt2csv.py -t POLYGON, t POLYGON_XYZ and -t POLYGON_ATTR (required by assign.py) as options; added adcirc2slf_stbtel.py that uses stbtel to convert from ascirc to *.slf mesh formats; added sel2vtk.py script that converts the Telemac's selafin results file to paraview's vtk format; added adcirc2vtk.py for visualizing TINs in Paraview; added sel2plot_1d.py for plotting cross sections and profiles from *.slf result files.

1.06 (February 22, 2016): Significant changes since last version; various improvements and code cleanup; complete re-write of the *.slf reader and writer class via module selafin_io_pp.py; added support for writing *.flt binary files; finished adcirc2slf.py script (no longer rely on stbtel for format conversions); added support for converting unstructured SWAN output to *.vtk for visualization via paraview; changed progressbar module; made all scripts in pputils work under python 2 and 3.

1.07 (April 7, 2017): Major updates to the code base; number of scripts increased nearly by double compared to previous version; added an ability to read and write ESRI Shapefiles (using pyshp module); added point and line cropping scripts; added ability to retain a specified time step from a SELAFIN file (for use in hot-starting); added an ability to extract data form a SELAFIN file using points and lines; cleaned up the interpolation scripts (everything now uses Scipy's cKDTree); added the code to generate and manage wave libraries; added a first version of the manual.

1.08 (September 6, 2020). Major updates to a number of scripts, with a heavily expanded scope. Updated the code so that PPUTILS can be sourced in a terminal (for now this feature works only on Linux).
